This Dataset is mainly The Dataset can be analyzed in different angels. First, we will see some tableau plot for data analysis and then a NLP problem description.

Tableau Data Analysis
The Tableau file is uploaded in this repository. First of all, we can have a view or idea regarding which authors have how many numbers of articles and how much upvotes they get for their articles in this dataset. Below a screenshot of tableau data analysis for these authors is given.

Here, we will have an idea regarding authors writing and their content. Also, We can see that the size of these circles defines which authors have larger writings and the color represents the number of upvotes of their writing. For example, davidreiss666 has most writings although he does not have many upvotes compared to other authors. Whereas, anutensi have most upvotes in his or her writings even though he or she was not one of the most written article holders over these years. From this, we can have an idea whenever we saw an article by an author. We will know if it will probably get an upvote or not.

Secondly, we can see over the year how these article numbers and upvotes are changing.

Although the number of articles is increasing each year compared to the previous years. The total number of upvotes received in the year 2015 is slightly highest. Maybe there are some writings style or contents or certain authors wrote more in that period which was more enticing than other periods.

Now whether an article is over_18 can be analyzed also. In the following portrayal, this is described.

Most of the articles are not over_18 as it deals with some kind of aggression which is not so appropriate for young people. Also, most upvotes articles are not over_18.

<p> I also create a dashboard that incorporates all of three plots. One dashboard story is given below.

  Where we can see in the year 2015 which authors wrote the article and among these articles how many got upvotes from which authors or how many are over_18. Thus through this dashboard, we can easily filter important information that we need.</p>
